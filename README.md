Fun with strings

## Program ! 

Write the following program in PHP where:

example input =  "HEELLLOLAA"

output = "H1E2L3O1L1A2"


## Program 2

Then write a program that will do the opposite:

(note, if the number is missing after the letter, the program should assume it is a 1)

example input = "H1E2L3O1LA2"

output =  "HEELLLOLAA"
